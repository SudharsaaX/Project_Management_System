Go to the Firebase Console.

Create a new project and enable Firestore & Authentication.

Get the Firebase config object from your project settings.

Replace the configuration in firebase.js inside the frontend/src/ folder:

js Copy Edit import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN", projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET", messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID", appId: "YOUR_APP_ID", };

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig); export default app; 🚀 Usage Guide 1️⃣ Creating a Project Navigate to the Dashboard. Click "Create Project" and enter the details. The project will be stored in Firestore. 2️⃣ Adding Tasks Open a project and go to the Tasks Page. Click "Add Task", enter the task name, and submit. The task gets saved in Firestore and is displayed instantly. 3️⃣ Managing Tasks Mark tasks as Completed ✅ or Pending ❌. Delete tasks if no longer needed. 4️⃣ Dark Mode Toggle Click on 🌙 Dark Mode to enable dark mode. The setting persists across pages using React Context API. 📝 Future Enhancements 🚀 AI-Powered Task Prioritization – Intelligent task sorting based on deadlines & workload. 🚀 Real-Time Chat Integration – Improve team collaboration. 🚀 Gantt Chart Visualization – Interactive progress tracking. 🚀 Mobile App Version – React Native support for mobile users.
